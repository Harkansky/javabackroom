## TP1

### What I did and why

I implemented classes and interfaces to represent the different components of the ToDo app.
The goal was to lighten the App class which was doing too much and used a lot of malpractice code techniques.
I divided the app into three main components : ToDo, DataStorage and CommandParser.

### What helped me and why

Making an UML diagram of the app helped me to understand the different components and their interactions.
I also used ChatGPT to understand ways of implementing different methods and classes of the app.

### What I found difficult

I found it difficult to understand the different ways of implementing the app. I had to try different ways of doing it before finding the one that suited me the most.

### What did not help me

The java documentation was not very clear and I had to look for other resources to understand how to implement the app.

### What did I need to change

I had to chage the structure of the `App.java` class because it was doing too much and was not respecting the SOLID Principles.
I also had to change the way I was implementing the app because I was doing it the wrong way.

## TP2

### What I did and why

I added the option for a new flag in the CLI to manage done tasks.
If used with the `list` command, it will display the tasks that are done.
If used with the `add` command, it will add a task as done.

### What helped me and why

I took example from the `list` command to implement the `done` command.
It allowed for smoother integration with the existing code.

### What I found difficult

Nothing was particularly difficult in this TP.

### What did not help me

The java documentation was not very clear and I had to look for other resources to understand how to implement the option.

### What did I need to change

I had to make modifications to the `TodoController` and `TodoItem` classes to add the new option.

## TP3

### What I did and why

New feature : migrate the file storage to another file storage.
For this, I added a new option called output (-o for short) and I implemented a new method called migrate in the StorageController class.

### What helped me and why

I took example from the `done` flag to implement the `output` flag.

### What I found difficult

I started to spend a lot of time on this project that I don't find very interesting, so I got angry and decided to scratch everything to go for the laziest solution.
I do not have all the necessary time, energy and interest to spend on this project.
I have other classes and projects, I have a job, I have family, friends and responsibilities, I still have to find free time and I don't like java that much.
3 hours a week is the best I can give.
It breaks my heart because I am an absolute cat lover and Ilia is very cute, but I have to make choices and I have to prioritize.

### What did not help me

The entire script of the Bee Movie.

### What did I need to change

Nothing, I just added stuff.
